# AirBnb-User-Destination-Prediction-Kaggle
On Airbnb, new users can reserve a room in more than 34,000 cities in 190+ countries. Airbnb has to be able to predict where new users will book their first travel experience in order to more correctly estimate demand, decrease the average time between first reservations, and offer more individualized content with their community.
This article can be used by Airbnb to forecast where a new user will book their first destination based on numerous user-provided data points. Here, we relied on previous user data from Airbnb rather than a machine learning model to forecast the outcome.
